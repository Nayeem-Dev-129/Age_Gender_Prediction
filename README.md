# 🎯 Age & Gender Prediction using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based Age and Gender Prediction system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the UTKFace dataset and deployed through a Streamlit web application for interactive image-based predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🖼️ Predicts age and gender from facial images
* 📊 Trained on real-world dataset (**UTKFace**)
* 🧠 Uses CNN for feature extraction
* 🌐 Simple web interface using Streamlit
* ⚡ Fast and efficient predictions

---

## 🧠 Model Details

* Architecture: **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
* Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
* Dataset: **UTKFace Dataset**
* Input: Face images (normalized)

### Outputs:

* Gender → Binary Classification (Male/Female)
* Age → Regression (continuous value)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the **UTKFace dataset**, which contains facial images labeled with:

* Age
* Gender
* Ethnicity

👉 This dataset helps the model learn diverse facial features across different age groups.

## ⚙️ Installation

1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nayeem-Dev-129/Age_Gender_Prediction.git

cd Age_Gender_Prediction
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run src/real_time_age_gender_prediction.py
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. Input image is uploaded through Streamlit
2. Face is detected using OpenCV Haar Cascade
3. Image is preprocessed (resize + normalization)
4. Passed into CNN model
5. Outputs:

   * Predicted Gender
   * Estimated Age
